# Water Quality Classifier (Enhanced Version – ResNet18 + Video Pipeline)

This repository contains the next-generation upgrade of my earlier Water Quality Classifier project.
The previous version was built using a simple CNN and focused only on image-based classification.
This enhanced release brings transfer learning with ResNet18, modular preprocessing, improved logging, and upcoming support for video-based water quality analysis.

# 🚀 Project Overview

This classifier predicts three water-quality categories:

- Clean
- Muddy
- Polluted

The system leverages:

- Transfer Learning (ResNet18) for high-accuracy feature extraction
- A dedicated preprocessing pipeline
- Structured logging for training and inference
- Video-based classification pipeline added (frame extraction + prediction).
